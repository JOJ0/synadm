## About

A CLI tool to help admins of [Matrix-Synapse homeservers](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse) conveniently issue commands available via its [Admin API](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/develop/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html#the-admin-api).



## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- a running Synapse instance
- an admin-enabled user on the instance
- the admin user's access token

`synadm` is designed to run either directly on the host running the Synapse instance or on a remote machine able to access Synapse's API port. Synapse's default Admin API endpoint address usually is http://localhost:8008/_synapse/admin or https://localhost:8448/_synapse/admin.




## Installation

### Install from PyPI

`pip3 install synadm`

### Install from git

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### 1. Check Python Version

`python3 --version` should show at least v3.6.x

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### 2. Clone Repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/joj0/synadm
```

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### 3. Install Package Globally

This will install `synadm` and all dependent Python packages to your system's global Python site-packages directory:

```
cd synadm
sudo pip install .
```

*Note: If you get an import error for setuptools, make sure the package is installed. Debian based systems: `sudo apt install python3-setuptools`, RedHat based: `sudo yum install python3-setuptools`* 

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### 4. Run

`synadm` should now run fine without having to add a path in front of it:

```
synadm -h
```

*Note: Usually setuptools installs a command wrapper to `/usr/local/bin/synadm`, but that depends on your system.*

*Note: In case you don't want `synadm` to be installed to a global system directory, you can find an [alternative way of installing](CONTRIBUTING.md#getting-the-source--installing) in the contribution docs*.

*Note: synadm is multi-user aware - it stores its configuration inside the executing user's home directory. See chapter [configuration](#configuration).*



## Configuration

### Getting an Admin Token

To find out your admin user's token in Element-Web: _Login as this user - "Click User Avatar" - "All Settings" - "Help & About" - Scroll down - "Advanced" - "Access Token"_

Or use synadm to fetch a token already. Use the fully qualified Matrix ID of the admin user:

```
synadm matrix login @admin_username:yourdomain.org
Password:
```

If you issue this command in a fresh `synadm` installation, [the configurator](#the-configurator) will launch anyway.

- Answer the questions.
- Set token to "invalid" at first, to convience `synadm` to launch the `matrix login` command (otherwise you'd get a "Configuration incomplete" error).
- After successfully entering your admin password you will be presented a token which you can finally set by re-launching the configurator as described below.

### The configurator

`synadm` asks for necessary configuration items on first launch automatically. Also whenever new mandatory configuration items where added (eg after an update), the user will be prompted for missing items automatically.

Configuration can be changed any time by launching the configurator directly:

```
synadm config
```

Configuration will be saved in `~/.config/synadm.yaml`


*Note: Be aware that once you configured `synadm`, your admin user's token is saved in the configuration file. On Posix compatible systems permissions are set to mode 0600, on other OS's it is your responsibilty to change permissions accordingly.*

### matrix-docker-ansible-deploy

To use `synadm` with Synapse homeservers that were installed using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) you have two options.

Access the Synapse Admin API's "via the public endpoint" similar to a Matrix client.

- In [vars.yaml](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook.md#configuring-the-ansible-playbook) set `matrix_nginx_proxy_proxy_matrix_client_api_forwarded_location_synapse_admin_api_enabled: true`.
- The API's are accessible on the Client-Server API port, at `https://matrix.DOMAIN`.
- Install `synadm` on your Docker host or on a separate machine.
- Configure `synadm` to access at `https://matrix.DOMAIN:443/_synapse/admin`

Alternatively, you can access the API's on the container network `matrix`.

- Synapse is accessible via the hostname `matrix-synapse` resolved by the internal Docker DNS server.
- The containers are connected internally via a network named `matrix` by default.
- Start a container on that same network and install `synadm` into it.
- Configure `synadm` to access at `http://matrix-synapse:8008/_synapse/admin` (http here, not https).

Find some more details about the topic in [this issue post on the matrix-docker-ansible-deploy repo](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/issues/1846#issuecomment-1135516112).

_Note that currently `synadm` is using a part of the Server-Server (Federation) API (`keys/v2/server`) to retrieve "its own homeserver name". This affects some of the `media` management commands. By default and also as the Matrix spec recommends, this API is not accessible via the Client-Server API port. We are working on a better solution to retrieve the own servername but as a workaround the `key` API's can be exposed by setting `matrix_synapse_http_listener_resource_names: ["client","keys"]` in [vars.yaml](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook.md#configuring-the-ansible-playbook)._

## Usage

Use the online help of the main command:

```
synadm -h
```

and of the available subcommands:

```
synadm version -h
synadm user -h
synadm room -h
```

You even can spare the `-h` option, `synadm` will show some abbreviated help for the executed subcommand anyway. For example:

```
synadm user
```
or
```
synadm user details
```

will show essential help for the particular subcommand right away.

*Note: A list of currently available commands is found in chapter [implementation status / commands list](#implementation-status--commands-list)* as well as in the following chapter.

### Command Line Reference

A detailed [Command Line Reference](https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index_cli_reference.html) can be found in `synadm's` readthedocs documentation.


### Advanced Usage

Examples of how `synadm` can be used in shell scripts and oneliners is
provided in the
[Scripting Examples](https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html)
docs chapter.

## Update

### Update PyPI Package

```
pip3 install synadm --upgrade
```

### Update git Installation

To update `synadm` to the latest development state, just update your git repo and reinstall:

```
cd synadm
git pull
pip install .
```

*Note: If you installed it to a Python venv, [activate it](CONTRIBUTING.md#3-set-up-a-python3-virtual-environment).*

*Note: If you installed it in [editable mode](CONTRIBUTING.md#4-install-in-editable-mode) (or for development), you can spare the `pip install .` command - just `git pull` and you're done.*

## Get in Touch

If you need advice on using synadm, have a feature idea or would like to discuss anything else around `synadm`, get in touch via Matrix!

We are hanging around in the official support room for Synapse, [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org). Usually you'll find `synadm` users there that might answer your questions already. If not, mentioning `synadm` will ping us with the help of Element's keyword notify feature and we'll try to get in touch.

The most direct way to reach synadm maintainers as well as seasoned users and Synapse admins is by joining [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at).

If you are sure you've found a bug that was not already reported, certainly directly opening an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/issues) is a valid option too. If unsure, ask in [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at) first.
